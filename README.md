# tkinter-worklist-creator-app
The app (Gross and Tare Assistant.py) is used to automatically create a worklist for a Biomicrolab XL100. The worklist can be tailored for different settings depending on the need of the user. The other script (standalone_XL100_result_data_format.py) is a script that gets run daily to reformat any new data recieved into a readable data for the database.
